## **Introduction**

###**Overview**

_Unburden_ is an application which will help users to manage their daily tasks better. _Unburden_ utilises a simple command line interface which allows users to keep track of their tasks without any form of clicking. _Unburden_ is written in Java.

###**Purpose**

This developer guide focuses primarily on the APIs used, the different components that work together and the main 4 components of _Unburden_. This developer guide will clearly explain the design of the software and also to showcase the core functionalities of the software. As such, the main purpose of this developer guide is to provide a general introduction and summary of the classes and components that are used within this application to help prospective developers who wish to develop _Unburden_ further.


###**Audience**

The main audience of this developer&#39;s guide is directed towards the students who may be interested to further develop this application or even prospective team members. This developer guide may also interest developers who are interested to join the team.

###**Good skills to have**

The entire application uses a huge range of APIs and requires a deep understanding of:

-  **Java programming language**

We have used Java and its APIs to write the main code hence it would be beneficial if you have a good grasp of Java. 


- **Eclipse IDE**

The main code is very long and using an IDE to help you in the process of writing, editing and testing would be very beneficial to you.


- **JavaFX**

Being familiar with JavaFX will enable you to edit the user interface smoothly since we use the JavaFX framework quite intensively throughout the project.

In essence, having all of the skills mentioned above will definitely help you to understand the code and hence allow you to add on to the existing code easily and efficiently. As such, we strongly recommend that you familiarize yourself with aforementioned skills. 

## **Setting up**

###**Prerequisites**

1. **JDK `1.8.0_60`**  or later<br>

    > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
    This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
    
2. **Eclipse** IDE
3. **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Do the steps 2 onwards given in
   [this page](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious))
4. **Buildship Gradle Integration** plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace


###**Importing the project into Eclipse**

1. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
2. Open Eclipse (Note: Ensure you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and **buildship** plugins as given 
   in the prerequisites above)
3. Click `File` > `Import`
4. Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`
5. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory
6. Click `Finish`

  > * If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' config files, choose to 'keep'.
  > * Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can even take up to 30 minutes for the set up to finish
      (This is because Gradle downloads library files from servers during the project set up process)
  > * If Eclipse auto-changed any settings files during the import process, you can discard those changes.
  
#### Troubleshooting project setup

**Problem: Eclipse reports compile errors after new commits are pulled from Git**
* Reason: Eclipse fails to recognize new files that appeared due to the Git pull. 
* Solution: Refresh the project in Eclipse:<br> 
  Right click on the project (in Eclipse package explorer), choose `Gradle` -> `Refresh Gradle Project`.
  
**Problem: Eclipse reports some required libraries missing**
* Reason: Required libraries may not have been downloaded during the project import. 
* Solution: [Run tests using Gradle](UsingGradle.md) once (to refresh the libraries).
 

## **Design**

### **Architecture**

> <img src="DeveloperGuideImages/Design.png" width="600">

The architectural design in figure 1 shows how the various components work in tandem with each other. `Main` only has one class MainApp and it is responsible for:

 1. Starting up _Unburden_: Initializes all components in order and ensures that the app starts to run
 2. Exiting _Unburden_: Shuts down all components in order and clears the memory

The rest of the app consists of 4 main components other than `Main`. They are :

 1. `UI` : Controls the UI of the app. This is the component that the user interacts with and is responsible for how the application looks to the user. 
 2. `Logic` : Parses the input and executes the command. Logic updates the Model and Storage according to the commands given by the user.
 3. `Model` : Holds the data during runtime. Works with UI to display the results of the commands to the user.
 4. `Storage`: Reads and writes data to the hard disk. Ensures that the data is stored properly even after Unburden has been closed.
 
Each component has a interface which all its classes implements and is named after the component itself.

Each of the four components
* Defines its API in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Model` component defines it's API in the `Model.java`
interface and exposes its functionality using the `ModelManager.java` class.<br> 

### **Event-driven nature of the design**

><img src="DeveloperGuideImages/SequenceDiagram2.png" width="600">

In figure 2, the diagram shows how the various components interact with one another when the user enters the command 'Done 1'.

Note how the `Model` simply raises a `ListOfTaskChangedEvent` when the data in _Unburden_ is changed,
instead of using `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk. 


><img src="DeveloperGuideImages/SequenceDiagram1.png" width="600">

In Figure 3, the diagram shows how the `Eventcenter` reacts to the event. This results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

Note how the event is being propagated through the `Eventscenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without being coupled to the `Model`. This reduces coupling and reduces regression when editing files. Hence, it is highly recommended that you follow this nature of the design when editing the project.

**The sections that below will go into more detail of each component.**



###**UI component**

><img src="DeveloperGuideImages/UI.png" width="600">


The `UI` component focuses on interacting with the user by displaying the necessary information to the user when requested. It is also responsible for the outlook of the application. The `UI` component consists of the abstract `UiPart` class which is the base class for the `UI` parts and each &quot;UI part&quot; is represented by a distinct part of the `UI` such as the panels or status bars.

In essence, the `UI` component makes use of JavaFx framework and the majority of the classes in _Unburden_ import javafx methods. The various layouts of each &quot;UI part&quot; are stores as .fxml files in the src/main/resources/view folder. These files are named according to the respective class names. For example, the layout of the HelpWindow.java is stored in src/main/resources/view/HelpWindow.fxml

####**API**

The `UI` component consists mainly of the following classes:

 1. `UI` 
 2. `UIManager` 
 3. `UIPart` 
 4. `UILoader` 
 5. `SummaryPanel` 
 6. `CommandBox` 
 7. `MainWindow` 
 8. `ResultDisplay` 
 9. `HelpWindow` 
 10. `TaskCard` 
 11. `TaskListPanel` 

These classes work together to form the interface which the user interacts with when using the app. Each of the class are meant to function solely on one part of the UI. For instance, the ResultDisplay class is responsible for displaying the results of a command from the user and the SummaryPanel class is responsible for displaying an up-to-date count of the the tasks that are overdue, undone and even tasks that are due tomorrow.

The UI also consists of a `MainWindow` class which is made up of these &quot;UI parts&quot; such as `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel`.

All of these classes, including the MainWindow class inherit from the abstract UiPart class.

The `UI` component

- Takes in user commands and passes it to Logic.
- Auto-updates when data in the `Model` change.
- Responds to events raised from various parts of _Unburden_
- Updates the `UI` accordingly.



###**Logic component**

> <img src="DeveloperGuideImages/Logic.png" width="600">

According to Figure 5, the diagram shows how each component of the `Logic` component communicates with one another. Notice how each command class extends the extract class `Command`.

The `Logic` component consists of the Parser class which is responsible to taking in the inputs from the `UI` component, deciphering it, and then creating a Command class that can handle the user&#39;s input correctly. `LogicManager` will then execute the command.

####**Main API Classes**

The API of the Logic component consists mainly of the following classes:

 1. `Logic` 
 2. `LogicManager` 
 3. `Parser` 
 4. All the command classes eg. `AddCommand`, `EditCommand`, `ListCommand`

These classes work together to categorize the different possible inputs from the user and sieves the important keywords out so that `Model` can continue executing the command entered by the user.

The `Logic` component

-  Receives the user&#39;s input and passes it to the `Parser` class to check for validity
-  Returns an error message to the user when a wrong input is given
-  Parses the input in `Parser` and decides which Command class is able to handle the input
-  Takes the command and executes it by calling `Model`
- `TaskResult` is created and returned to the `UI` to be displayed to the user

> <img src="DeveloperGuideImages/LogicDelete.png" width="600">

The diagram in figure 6 shows the interactions between the `Logic` component for the calling the execute() method on "delete 1". 



###**Model component**

> <img src="DeveloperGuideImages/Model.png" width="600">

You can see how the different components of the model interact with one another in figure 6.

The `Model` component is mainly responsible for executing the outputs from the `Logic` component. It is also responsible for storing all the in-app data such as the user&#39;s preferences and data which is needed when executing commands.

####**Main API Classes**

The API of `Model` consists of the following classes:

 1. `Model`
 2. `ModelManager` 
 3. `ListOfTask` 
 4. `UserPref` 
 5. `ReadOnlyListOfTask`

The API of the `Model` component is in the `Model` class which consists of the main features of the task manager such as &#39;add&#39;, &#39;delete&#39; and updates the task manager accordingly. The `ModelManager` class, which represents the in-memory model of the task manager data, inherit from the `Model` interface.

The `Model` component

 - Stores the user&#39;s preference <br>
 - Stores _Unburden&#39;s_ data <br>
 - Updates according to the command class called by `Logic`
 - Returns the result of each command back to the `UI` for feedback
 
 
 
###**Storage component**

> <img src="DeveloperGuideImages/Storage.png" width="600">

According to figure 8, the diagram shows how each component interacts with one another. It also shows how each type of data is stored in the respective classes.

The `Storage` component primarily focuses on storing data. Any data related to the application will be saved within `Storage` and can be accessed later when requested. `Storage` works closely with `Model` to read and write data from the app as and when the user requests to add or show existing data.

####**Main API Classes**

The API of `Storage` consists of the following classes:

 1. `JSonUserPrefsStorage` 
 2. `Storage` 
 3. `StorageManager` 
 4. `TaskListStorage`
 5. `UserPrefsStorage`
 6. `XmlAdaptedTask`
 7. `XmlAdaptedTag`
 8. `XmlFileStorage`
 9. `XmlSerializableTaskList`
 10. `XmlTaskListStorage`

These classes are responsible for storing the data from the user and also works with the Model component to execute the commands given by the user. 

The `Storage` component

 - Saves the data entered in by the user and also read it back to `Model` when requested <br>
 - Saves user preferences and read it back when needed <br>
 - Saves the `Userpref` objects json format and the data in _Unburden_ in xml format <br> 




## **Implementation**

We are using java.util.logging package for logging. The LogsCenter class is used to manage the logging leveles and logging destinations.

Some things to note when using the java.util.logging package for logging:

- The logging level can be adjust by toggling the logLevel setting in the configuration file.
- Use the LogCenter.getLogger() to get the Logger for each class. This will also log messages according to the specified logging level.
- The console will display the current log messages. Alternatively, you may open the .log file to see the log messages.

####**Logging Levels**

The following are some of the logging levels which you might encounter when doing logging:

- SEVERE : This means that there is a critical problem which may cause the termination of _Unburden_.
- WARNING : Continue with caution.
- INFO : Information showing the noteworthy actions by _Unburden_.
- FINE : Details that are not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging. E.g Print the actual list instead of just its size.



## **Testing**

Tests can be found in the./src/test/javafolder.

In Eclipse:

- To run all tests, right-click on the src/test/java folder and choose Run as &gt; JUnit Test
- To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose to run as a JUnit test.

Using Gradle:

- See [Gradle.md](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1617S1/addressbook-level4/blob/master/docs/UsingGradle.md) for how to run tests using Gradle.

We have two types of tests:

1. **GUI Tests** - These are _System Tests_ that test _Unburden_ by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the guitests package.
2. **Non-GUI Tests** - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
	1. _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. <br>
	2. g. address.commons.UrlUtilTest <br>
	3. _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). <br>
	4. g. address.storage.StorageManagerTest <br>
	5. Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together.<br>
	6. g. address.logic.LogicManagerTest <br>



**Headless GUI Testing** 
Thanks to the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

Look up the UsingGradle.md file to learn how to run tests in headless mode.

###**Troubleshooting tests**

Problem: Tests fail because of NullPointException when an AssertionError is expected

- Reason: Assertions are not enabled for JUnit tests. This can happen if you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. _Neon_r later)
- Solution: Enable assertions in JUnit tests as described.
- Delete run configurations created when you ran tests earlier.



## **Future Works**

While this app has been extensively developed, we feel that there is still room for improvement and can therefore be improved further. As such, the main reason for this section of the developer guide is to suggest possible improvements to _Unburden._

For future and prospective developers or students who are interested to join our team, do note that the following list is not exhaustive.

Some possible additions to be made:

- Allow this app to be run on a mobile device such as a mobile phone or tablet
- Create a login system which will protect each user&#39;s data and allow them to access their data from any device
- Add animations so as to appeal to a larger audience
- Implement a synchronous system based on a clock that will remind the user (possibly even when the application is not running) when he/she has a deadline approaching

## **Dev Ops**

###**Build Automation**

We use Gradle to build automation. Do take a look at [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

###**Continuous Integration**

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects.
Do take a look at [UsingTravis.md](UsingTravis.md) for more details.

###**Creating a new Release**

Here are the steps to create a new release.
 
 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
 2. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.6`.
 2. [Create a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) 
    and upload the .JAR file which you generated from Gradle in step 1.
   
###**Managing Dependencies**

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, _Unburden_ depends on the
[Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing. Managing these dependencies
can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which
is better than these alternatives.<br>

- Import those libraries in the repo but this is not recommended as it significantly increases the repo size<br>
- Require developers to download those libraries manually but this is not recommended because other developers have to do extra work<br>

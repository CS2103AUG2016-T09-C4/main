/**
 * There are 4 diagrams of Developer guide drawn by myself
 * It is of good quality and better than the diagrams our team pick in my point of view
 * The reason why my team did not use this is because that i make some errors at first time
 * and the one who wrote developer guide is a little bit mad at me and decide not to use my diagrams 
 * but copy from addressbook and modified by his own
 * I finished the errors before he finished the diagrams but they still decide not to use mine
 * welcome to verify if any of you have different opinoins
